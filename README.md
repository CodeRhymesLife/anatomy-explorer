# Anatomy Explorer
This was part of a class project for Virtual Reality Interfaces (IND E 543) at University of Washington. The purpose of this project was to gain experience building virtual worlds in Unreal Engine. My group and I took things a step further and integrated the Leap Motion so we could explore anatomy with natural input.
